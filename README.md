Hello! If you found this from pt welcome!,, 

**read before you interact,,,**

I Dont mind being cuddled at all regardless if C+h isnt in my name Since i dont mind having people near me if im comfortable, unless i have dni or ask to be left alone, I have autophobia. & sometimes take jokes about being left seriously, i also do get quiet if you end up leaving mid-coversation & dont actually come back. I have moodswings sometimes so if i suddenly completely shift in mood thats probably why. i dont take being yelled at well & can be sensitive about it, i dont mind if its not directed in a rude way but jst iwc. i lack social skills in some ways & sometimes i can respond in ways that dont make sense or jst not say anything at all.
